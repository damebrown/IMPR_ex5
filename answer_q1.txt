Q1:
Describe the effect of increasing the residual blocks on its performance for each task:
both quantitatively in terms of the plot you got
and qualitatively in terms of the differences in the image outputs of each model.

A1:
Denoising task:
Unlike the Deblurring task, the error of the model we built does not monotonically decrease through the whole five runs
of the program. in the first 2-3 runs (meaning for depths 1-3) the error decreased, but for hight depths (4-5) the error
significantly increased. This may accur due to overfitting of the model.
In terms of the differences in the image outputs of each model,  in accordance to the graph, the first 3 depths' (1-3)
result increased for each depth, while the other depths (4-5) had a major decrease in the quality of output, which
approves the graph's indication.

Deblurring task:
In the deblurring task, the bigger the residual amount got, the smaller the error got, meaning that the model we build
acted in such a way that it preforms better the more blocks it had.
With that being said, we can notice that although the error itself is monotonicaly deacrising, the speed in which it
decreases (meaning the graph's derivative) is monotonically decreasing, meaning the more residual blocks a model has,
the smaller the impact of another added residual block has on the model.
In terms of the differences in the image outputs of each model, in accordance to the graph, the first 4 depths' (1-4)
result increased for each depth, while the changing of the improvment descended each iteration, while the fifth run
(5 res blocks) didn't always had a significant improvement.
